      <description>ManusCrypt Based on Malware Bazaar this sample is ManusCrypt. The first part seems to be a dropper, overall the sample downloads two files and unpacks those in a multi step process. Based on the supplied sample this was downloaded from vk[.]com. The information regarding ManusCrypt seems limited, so it is hard to tell if this sample might really be ManusCrypt.
 First stage: Uses com objects to download and execute files Second stage: Simple obfuscated strings to load functions and load shellcode from a previous file into memory Third stage: XOR decrypt some memory and load functions via hashes.</description>
